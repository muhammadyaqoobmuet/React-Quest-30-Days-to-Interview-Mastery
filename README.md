  <summary>Question 1</summary>
  Create a `PhoneOtpForm` component with an input field for the phone number. Validate that it contains exactly 10 digits and only numbers. Show an alert if invalid. On valid input, display `"OTP sent to {phoneNumber}"`.

  Create an `InputOtp` component with 6 input fields. Each field should allow only one digit. Automatically move to the next field after entering a digit. Pressing Backspace should move to the previous field if empty. Clicking an empty field should move the cursor to the first empty input.

  When all 6 digits are entered, automatically submit the OTP and log it as `console.log("Logged in successfully", otp)`. Add a Submit OTP button for manual submission.
